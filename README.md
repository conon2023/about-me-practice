***I am your flight captain on the course and would like to welcome every visitor aboard flight Norwich-code-102d5: Intro to Software Development***. 

It is such a beautiful day today! 

To make this a very remarkable experience for you, we have on board as well **Rich, Chris, Sam and James.** Everyone is here to make this a great learning experience for all. 

Time to fasten your seat belts as we navigate this 10 weeks journey. We might experience **a bit of turbulence** at different times, including during ascent and descent. But nothing to worry. We will be fine once we are at our **cruising altitude**.  

Meanwhile, feel free to explore some of our in-fligth entertainments as listed below. They have been organised in such a way you can go to any section of interest directly or follow as we move along. The contents are designed to entertain, inform and educate you on some cutting-edge discoveries in the field of software development. 

Finally, it is important you check back from time to time as these materials are constantly updated.  

Enjoy your flight!
