***The Incredible Me!***

>**“The illiterates of the twenty-first century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”- Alvin Toffler**

Getting to know me is like trying to figure out how deep the center of the earth is. And yes, I mean that literally. At this stage of my life, I have become so many thing through hard work and perseverance that I understand mastery and excellence in any field go hand-in-hand with the right mind-set and hardwork. With the right mind-set and ample time dedication for practice, *the sky will no longer be ***the*** limit but ***a*** starting point.* 

## Where do I start from?

I love to read and have read and read and still reading. I read across a wide range of fields - ***technology, education, farming, entrepreneuship and personal development.*** I started reading at a very young age and can remember vividly going to the library in my community to read. I was 5 years at the time. I loved the children's corner and read quite a lot of very interesting classics at the time. My love for reading eventually spanned other genres as I grew up. In retrospect, I can now understand why it happened the way it did considering the number of children and teenagers I have also helped to develop their love for reading while in Nigeria.  

## Educational and Professional Background:
I have a degree in **Electronic Engineering**, a **Master's in Educational Technology** and a **Certificate in Entreprenuership** and currently working on developing expertise in **Programming and Data Analytics**. The truth is, we can only give what we have. I am only able to help others because I helped myself well-enough to be in a position to help them. Problems I can't solve for others, I look out for those who can.   

I love teaching and will use whatever opportunity that presents itself to teach others what I know. I am able to help others understand complex concepts because I work to achieve understanding first. My experience convinces me that it so much easiers teaching others what one fully understands than what is not fully understood. **This beauty of having trained as a teacher and educationist is that I can help all style of learners in the process.** I am sure that new role as a softward developer and data analyst will also help develop others at some point. And the cycle continues when these others also help others develop themselves. The end point will be a better world for all of us.   

*My love for learning!*

I love learning. I was able to get myself to a high level of proficiency in these areas and, of course, through the same hardwork, time commitment and the right mindset:

- Creative writing
- Public presentation (Speaking) Skills
- Phonetics - this made it possible for me to help a good number of people read and spell - children and adults inclusive. 
- Photography, Video editing and Digital marketing. 
 

In order of preference, my learning goals are, first and foremost:

1. To myself - I believe in the continuous and never ending improvement ***CANEI*** philosophy. When I make myself better, I am in a much better position to help others get better too. 

2. To others - I can't trade for anything the excitement I see and that *AHA!* feeling on the faces of people when a complex subject has been dymistified for them. Those who have passed such moments can relate to it. 

3. To Community - I have helped and would love to continue helping as many as I can help - whether direct or remote. I am highly optimistic and positive that interest at this time in software development will also lead to many others being massively helped to discover the incredible benefits of this amazing field.  

4. Financial Independence - Lastly, I have seen the correlation between excellence and financial rewards. In clear terms, the more value we carry as individuals, the more we can give to others and our communities. And the more we can give to others and our communities, the more we are positioned to have enough to live whatever life we have always dreamt of.   

## My Hobbies

I love to play. I guess this has impacted my life's work greatly. Playing helps me connect with my students - whether adults or children. I am actively involved in sports - *tennis, football, volleyball, badminton and swimming - to be precise.* I also play a couple of great conventional board games like *scrabble, monopoly, chess, cashflow and whirredplay.* 

I have equally played very active roles in *sales and marketing, customers services and accounting*. These skills have helped me develop and sustain a strong business sense and mindset. 

I became interested in *farming* in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. Because we were all indoors, a great percentage of my time was used to farm vegetables in my house. I planted and harvested *tomatoes, bell and cayenne peppers, cabbage, lettuce, onions, cucumbers, watermelons and others*. I equally invested another percentage of this indoor time to teaching kids remotely. 

In addition, I equally got into photography, video editing and digital marketing. I was able to use these skills to promote a  children's reading, writing and speaking club in Nigeria that I was seriously involved with. In all of these, I had to learn the importance of helping others by having helped ourselves first. Once again, we can only give what we have. The lock-down during the 2020 pandemic remains at the bottom of my interest in technology - *whether in education, software and/or business.   

A great love of mine is also travelling. This is something I totally enjoy. However, I enjoy travelling best when it is with my family (wife and children).


Well, there you have a bit of me. I hope you truly agree with my incredibility. Time and space will not all me write about everything I wish to write. But whatever you have read is a good start. My prayer is for everyone of us to find what truly resonates with his or her uniqueness. 

Cheers and have a great week ahead!

Chidi Ononye.
